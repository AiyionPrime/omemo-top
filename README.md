# OMEMO.top

This is the Jekyll site repository
behind [omemo.top](https://omemo.top).

We try to track the progress of different **OMEMO** Implementations in
various XMPP clients. This is a joint effort, so:

Your contribution is more than **welcome**.

## Running the site locally

* Get Jekyll up and running according to the
  [GitHub Pages Docs](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).
* Clone this Repository and run Jekyll
  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:bascht/omemo-top.git
  cd omemo-top
  bundle
  bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```

If any of the above steps fail:
Just [open an issue](https://github.com/bascht/omemo-top/issues/new)
and let us know.
